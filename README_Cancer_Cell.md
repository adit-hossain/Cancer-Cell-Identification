# Cancer Cell Identification using Deep Learning

This project uses a neural network built with **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-learn** to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Neural network model building
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Scikit-learn.

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage
Open and run `Cancer_Cell_Identification_Pro.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
